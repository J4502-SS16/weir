		<div class="item-1 item">Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.</div>
		<div class="item-2 item">The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.</div>
		<div class="item-3 item">Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?</div>
		<div class="item-4 item">Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help. Would you please stop calling me that? Sure, Leia. Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes. I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right. Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel. Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.</div>
		<div class="item-5 item">Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person!</div>
		<div class="item-6 item">But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information.</div>
