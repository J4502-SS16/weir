		<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Rob Weir, <a href="mailto:weirr@missouri.edu" title="Email the instructor">weirr@missouri.edu</a>; 573-882-5057; 207 Lee Hills Hall</p>
		<p><strong>Office hours:</strong> 11:30-12:30 Tuesdays or by appointment.</p>

		<p>In today's media landscape, producers and designers need to be thinking about designing a user experience, not a static product. The goal is to anticipate how users/readers/viewers might want to consume information and design an interface that will lead to a seamless experience. Designers need to understand what it means to be an information architect. They need to have a firm grasp of reader behavior, navigation and interface design. As sophisticated multimedia journalists, they need to know when multimedia adds value and contributes to storytelling and when it simply slows load time and clutters a project.</p>

		<h2 id="about">About J4502</h2>
		<p>In this class, you will learn to ask and answer these questions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>How does this story or strategic message want to be told or conveyed? Does it have a beginning, middle and end, or is it non-linear? What media are most appropriate to use? And what platform? We will learn to stage and frame our packages.</li>
			<li>How might people want to consume the information I'm offering? It's important to realize that we can't tell someone how to consume our story or product. We must learn to anticipate the many perfectly valid reading habits users might bring to the table, and be ready to accommodate a variety of reader behaviors.</li>
			<li>How can I apply the basics of good information design (typography, color, grid, images, etc.) and learn to marry them with motion and sound? </li>
			<li>How can I innovate in my storytelling? We'll look at ways to move beyond the usual — beyond the arranging of elements — and use interactivity to help redefine the idea of story or product.</li>
			<li>How can I incorporate web standards and best practices into my web design work? It doesn't matter how brilliant your multimedia projects/sites are if they take 10 minutes to load or aren't accessible.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
		<p>This is not a class in software. It's a class in concepts and critical thinking and in how to plan multimedia packages. While we will go over the highlights of some of these skills and programs in class, you'll learn most of what you need to know on your own. You will learn to execute your ideas using tools that are common in today's workplace. However, know that it's crucial that you be able to quickly adapt your process as the tools and conventions change.  You will learn to execute your projects in XHMTL and CSS, using Dreamweaver or the HTML editor of your choice. Additionally, you'll learn how to add more interactivity to your sites using  HTML5, jQuery and CSS3. You will also do mockups of your sites in a layout program (ex: InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop).</p>

		<h2 id="books">Textbooks and readings</h2>
		<h4>Required</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Edition, by Jeffrey Zeldman and Jeremy Keith</li>
				<li>Subscription to class curriculum on teamtreehouse.com for software training through video tutorials. $9 per month.</li>
			</ul>
		<h4>Recommended:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't Make Me Think! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, by Steve Krug</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Many of our readings will be online articles. Links will be provided <a href="http://www.delicious.com/jschooltiger" title="Instructor's Delicious account">on my Delicious account.</a></p>

		<h3>About Treehouse Tutorials</h3>
		<p>You are not required to purchase a Treehouse subscription. However, if you have little previous experience with XHTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, I highly encourage you to buy the subscription. It's good for beginners, because the videos provide detailed, easy-to-follow instructions.</p>
		<p>Don't want to buy the subscription? If you're more comfortable with these skills, you could get by searching for free tutorials online, but realize that this will require more work on your part.</p>

		<h2 id="resources">Class resources</h2>
		<p>The readings, assignments and syllabus will be posted to Blackboard. Additionally, we have <a href=": http://jmultimediafall12.wordpress.com/" title="Our class blog">a class blog.</a> You'll be posting critiques to multimedia projects here (see Assignments for more details).</p>
		<p>All examples I show in class can be found <a href="http://www.delicious.com/jschooltiger" title="Instructor's Delicious account">on my Delicious account.</a>. Look for the J4502 tag.</p>
